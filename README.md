# SOLE SEARCHIN'
### Stretch Project

## Abstract:
SOLE SEARCHIN' is a Mod 3 group (three persons) frontend project at Turing School of Software Design. While this project offers us the opportunity to further our understanding of React, components, state, props and fundamental JavaScript principals. It also presented us with the challenge of expanding our understanding of software development. We were allowed to choose a `stretch technology` (a technology outside of our current curriculum), to study, and build a web application around.

We chose to learn a few backend technologies and principals. SOLE SEARCHIN' is an application for "Sneaker Heads" that allows them to be a part of the world's first evolving sneaker encyclopedia. Their knowledge can be added via comments or a sneaker creator form.
